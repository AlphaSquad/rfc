## Binning evaluation container

 * Version:    0.8.0
 * Maintainer: Peter Belmann <pbelmann@cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de>

### Outline

This specification describes the interface for containerised binning evaluation applications. 
A binning evaluation application should validate the assigned [BIN and/or TAXID ids](https://github.com/bioboxes/rfc/blob/master/data-format/binning.mkd#the-binning-output-format) 
of a binning container.

In addition to the specifications described below, this container MUST implement the
specifications defined in 'Generic bioinformatics container'. 

### Inputs

* **CONT_BINNING_FILE**: This variable MUST be present in the container
  environment. This specifies the absolute path of where the file containing
  the computed binning and/or taxonomic groups MUST be created. The created
  file MUST be in [BINNING format](https://github.com/bioboxes/rfc/blob/master/data-format/binning.mkd#the-binning-output-format).

* **CONT_TRUE_BINNING_FILE**:This variable MUST be present in the container environment.
  This specifies the absolute to the file containing the true binning and/or taxonomic assignments.
  This file MUST be in [BINNING format](https://github.com/bioboxes/rfc/blob/master/data-format/binning.mkd#the-binning-output-format).

* **CONT_CONTIGS_FILE_LISTING**: This variable MUST be present in the container
  environment. It specifies the absolute path, inside the
  container, of a text file. This file MUST contain a list of absolute paths
  beginning with a slash ('/'), or paths relative to this file, which points to
  FASTA contigs.

* **CONT_SCAFFOLD_CONTIG_MAPPING**: This variable MAY be present in the container environment. 
  It specifies the path to a tab separated file with the scaffold name in the first column and the contig name in the second column.
  The sequence names have to be equal to the sequence names specified in the FASTA files listed in **CONT_CONTIGS_FILE_LISTING**. 

* **CONT_NCBI_TAXONOMY**: This variable MUST be present in the container. It specifies the path
  to a directory with the ncbi [taxonomy database](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz) containing .dmp files.

* **CONT_OUTPUT_DIR**: This variable MUST be present in the container
  environment. This variable specifies the absolute path of where the directories/files MUST
  be created containing the metrics describing the binning quality.

### Outputs

The container MUST generate files of metrics in the directory $CONT_OUTPUT_DIR from evaluating the quality of the binning in the file $CONT_BINNING_FILE.
